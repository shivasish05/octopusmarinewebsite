# assets/

This folder stores image assets used by the site. Place the site logo and partner logos here using the filenames referenced in `index.html`.

Expected files and recommended formats:

- `assets/octopus-logo.jpg` (or `.png`/`.webp`) — site header logo. Recommended max height: ~128px; keep file width reasonable (<= 800px) and compress for web.

- `assets/partners/maersk.png`
- `assets/partners/emirates.png`
- `assets/partners/dhl.png`
- `assets/partners/blue-dart.png`
- `assets/partners/jnpt.png`
- `assets/partners/msc.png`
- `assets/partners/fedex.png`
- `assets/partners/adani.png`
- `assets/partners/cma-cgm.png`
- `assets/partners/lufthansa.png`
- `assets/partners/ups.png`
- `assets/partners/vrl.png`

Notes:
- PNG or WebP is preferred for logos with transparency; JPEG is fine for photographic logo variants.
- Use `loading="lazy"` (already in `index.html`) for partner logos.
- If you upload files with different names, either rename them to match `index.html` or let me know and I'll update the markup.

If you'd like, I can fetch and add official partner logos for you (I will request permission before downloading any copyrighted assets).
